# This is Tabs. 
## It is a web application with a vue front end and a node backend for presenting music tabs and videos in one place. 

This project comes from a youtube tutorial and then I added ideas and changed some features.
It is currently in development (as I get time ...updating in 2021) and the UI and minor functionality is undergoing changes. 
However, the server side code has followed the tutorial very closely with slight additions and
subtractions from the tutorial design.

updates will be coming july of 2021
